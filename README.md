# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to help Pewlett Hackard and its several thousand employees with some changes occuring in the near future. As babyboomers begin to retire at a rapid rate, Pewlett Hackard is looking to offer retirement packages to those who meet certain criteria. With this, they want to know which positions would need to be filled in the near future. We also need to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We are to help Bobby, the HR Analyst, perform employee research and find these answers to future proof Pewlett Hackard.

- The title with the most retiring staff are senior engineers
- Only 2 managers are eligible for retirement
- Senior staff holds the second highest number of employees that are at retirement age
- The role of engineer, at any level, contains the most number of retirement aged staff

## Summary

Pewlett Hackard has a total of 72,458 that could retire at any moment. Because even those that are not at senior levels in this data, are still set to retire, additional queries that need to be ran are the number of employees not set to retire. From this newly created table, we then need to run a query on those employees who are not at senior levels, and include them in mentorship programs so that they can fill the high-level positions, such as Senior Engineer, that would soon be left vacant. Another query that could be run to help aid in this decision, would be to look at start dates and set possible parameters for those who have been with the company for a longer amount of time.
